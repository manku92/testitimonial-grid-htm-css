            a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the intro course
            and
            found it incredibly fun. I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
            time of my life. Since completing the course. I`ve successfully switched careers, working as Software
            Engineer
            at VR startup"</p>

          <p class="lead-text">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
          <p class="highlight-text">" Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
            structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
            former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
            staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
            team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
            tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple
            offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
